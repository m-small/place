Pseudo-Linear Approximation to Chaotic Evolution - a Julia library

Currently under development. 

Pseudolinear models can be expressed as a linear some of nonlinear functions. That is, the nonlinearity is restricted to the individual terms. Radial basis function networks are an example. The code contained here will develop a parsimonious modelling package to bbuild a approxiamtion to the nonlinear evolution operator of a dynamical system from observed time series.
